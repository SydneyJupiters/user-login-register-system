### How to run
(Prerequisites: I used Xamp to run the server. You will have to download the latest version)
> Clone the repo
> Make sure you place the folder in your local C Drive > xampp > htdocs (once xampp is downloaded)
> Run Apache and MySQL servers on xampp
> On your browser go to "http://localhost/user-login-register-system/index.php" to take you to the login screen
> Also on the browser go to "http://localhost/phpmyadmin/index.php" and create new database called 'user_logins' and a table called 'users'
with an id, username and password fields
